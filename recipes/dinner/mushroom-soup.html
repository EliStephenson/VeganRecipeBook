            <ol>
                <li>Slice/tear up the mushrooms. Add the olive oil and onions to a pot over medium heat; once the onions are soft, add the garlic. Add the butter and mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Pour in white wine and wait for alcohol to cook off, or pour in veggie broth.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining veggie broth and the herbs. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for about 15 minutes. Transfer half of the soup to a blender and blend up, along with the cashews, miso, and soy sauce. Mix this back into the soup and simmer for another 5 minutes. Remove the herbs and serve with olive oil and chives.</li>
