            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Warm the soy milk in the microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix the warm soy milk, sugar, and yeast; let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the melted vegan butter, salt, and flour. Stir with a large spoon until it comes together. You can add additional flour, 1/3 cup at a time, until the mixture is soft and slightly sticky but pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
                <li>Turn the dough onto floured surface and knead for 3-4 minutes, until you have a smooth ball of dough. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a towel, and let it rise in an oven with the door cracked (turn the oven to 170 degrees F, then turn it off).</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a clean counter with flour. Punch the dough down, then roll it out to a large rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Sprinkle more flour as needed.</li>
                <li>Spread the 6 tbsp butter over the dough, leaving an inch around the edges. Follow with the brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>
                <li>Starting with the long end closest to you, roll the dough into a tight log. Cut into 12 evenly-sized rolls and place in a 9x13 sprayed casserole dish.</li>
                <li>Bake for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the rolls are baking, whisk the the cream cheese, vanilla, and sweetener together.</li>
                <li>Allow the rolls to cool for 10 minutes, then cover with the icing. Enjoy!</li>
                <li>NOTE: For pumpkin cinnamon rolls, make the following changes to the dough ingredients: 1 1/2 cups soy milk, 1/4 cup melted vegan butter, 3/4 cup pumpkin puree, 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice.</li>
