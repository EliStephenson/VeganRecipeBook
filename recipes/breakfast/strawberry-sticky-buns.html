            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking dish with parchment. Combine 1 cup of the strawberries with the sugar and bake for 25 minutes. They should be broken down and darker. Separately, for the filling, combine the cinnamon, brown sugar, zest, and nutmeg in a bowl.</li>
                <li>To make the caramel, mix the vegan butter, maple syrup, vanilla extract, brown sugar, and cinnamon in another bowl.</li>
                <li>To make the dough, add the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, yeast, salt) to a mixing bowl and stir to combine. Add the oil and warm water and combine until it forms a sticky ball. Let it rest for 10 minutes, covered with a damp dish towel.</li>
                <li>When the strawberries are done roasting, reset the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Transfer the roasted strawberries into a separate bowl, leaving the juice behind in the pan. Mash the strawberries with a fork and add 3 tbsp of butter. Chill in the fridge for about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Use a spatula to scrape the strawberry juices off of the parchment and into the pan. Mix in the remaining caramel ingredients that were combined earlier.</li>
                <li>Roll out the dough to approximately 18 x 12 inches. Spread the strawberry butter onto the dough, leaving 1 inch of one long side without filling. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mix on top, then sprinkle with the ½ cup of diced strawberries.</li>
                <li>Starting on the long side with the filling to the edge, roll up the dough tightly into a log shape. Cut into 9 or 12 rolls and place each one in the pan, on top of the strawberry caramel. Cover with a damp tea towel and allow to rise for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Bake for 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
