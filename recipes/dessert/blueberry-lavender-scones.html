            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
                <li>Blend up the flaxseeds and lavender, if they are not already ground.</li>
                <li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder, flaxseeds, lavender, salt, and granulated sugar.</li>
                <li>Add the butter. Use your hands or a pastry cutter to work it into the dry ingredients. It should resemble coarse crumbs.</li>
                <li>Pour in the milk and vanilla, stirring until just combined. Add up to ¼ cup more milk if the dough seems too dry. Fold in the blueberries.</li>
                <li>On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until it comes together. Flatten the dough into a circle, about 1 inch thick.</li>
	<li>Using a pizza cutter or knife, cut it like you would a pizza, into 8 pieces.</li>
	<li>Bake the scones for 22 to 26 minutes, until lightly golden brown on top.</li>
	<li>To make the glaze, simply whisk the powdered sugar with your desired liquid (lemon juice, orange juice, lavender syrup, or just milk).</li>
